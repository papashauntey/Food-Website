shrimp is very good
an average shrimp smells good as well
95% of the time a shrimp is adorable
the taste is exquisite
and very crunchy
mostly due to the shell
most remove the shell
but it has a lot of protein
and even though it gives tooth aches
the shell is the second best part
the best part is the soft inner meat
you bite in and it takes you to a new world
a world of shrimp
shrimp cocktails are even better
due to the variety of sauces
but i prefer them raw
the salty taste of the sea
and the germs within
and the juicy eyes
but pet shrimps are the best
they are like cute little sea dogs
without fur of course
finally shrimps make the world a better place
